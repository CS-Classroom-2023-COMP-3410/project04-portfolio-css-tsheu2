Timothy "TJ" Sheu - Project 4 Reflection

3. Write a `reflection.md` file to explain your design choices, the challenges you faced, and how you approached responsiveness.

It was initially difficult to decide on design choices and choose which areas to modify. I ended up using the Bootstrap framework. At first it was hard to get used to using the framework 
and understanding how each function worked. However, the longer I spent, the easier it got. I struggled most with changing how images looked on different devices. I also struggled with 
implementing some of the features I wanted without using JavaScript.

My approach to responsiveness was to first focus on creating a visually appealing and easy-to-use experience. After ensuring that all accesibility features worked and the site was where I wanted it,
I then moved onto ensuring that the site worked across different sized devices. I intentionally chose unoffensive colors and minimalistic designs to highlight the content and avoid overwhelming smaller
devices. To ensure the compatability of the site on different devices, I focusde on using units like em and rem instead of absolute pixel sizes. I also made sure that content was accessible through 
vertical scrolling and not horizontal.
